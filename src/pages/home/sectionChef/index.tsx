                        The award-winning chef Athanasios Kargatzidis, passionate about food and restaurants for over 25 years, has been cooking, researching, and studying around the world. This led him to open one of the most renowned restaurants in Lebanon and the MENA region. Describing his food as &#x201C;fusion cooking,&#x201D; he values flavors and textures rather than traditions and origins.</p>
